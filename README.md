CheapChat is a local-first desktop chat client for BYOK usage with OpenRouter. The goal is narrow: save your own OpenRouter API key once, browse cached free-tier models, pick one manually, chat with streaming responses, and keep your conversation history on your machine.

This repository is open source. The core app scaffold is in place and production builds work. Development startup still has an unresolved Electron runtime issue in this environment, so the project should currently be treated as an early OSS codebase rather than a polished public release.

## What it does

- OpenRouter-first BYOK flow
- OS keychain storage for your API key via `keytar`
- Cached model catalog with free-model filtering
- Local SQLite persistence for conversations and messages
- Streaming chat responses from the Electron main process
- Abort support for in-flight requests
- Security-oriented Electron architecture with a typed preload bridge

## Stack

- Electron
- React
- TypeScript
- Vite / electron-vite
- Zustand
- Tailwind CSS
- better-sqlite3
- keytar

## Current status

- `pnpm build` passes
- the main app architecture and UI flow are implemented
- `pnpm dev` is not stable yet in this environment because of an Electron module-resolution/runtime mismatch during startup

If you want to contribute, the highest-value first task is fixing the dev runner so the local development loop matches the build output cleanly.

## Getting started

### Requirements

- Node.js `>= 22`
- `pnpm`
- macOS, Linux, or Windows with native build tooling required by `better-sqlite3` and `keytar`

### Install

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Run in development

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Known issue as of March 31, 2026: this currently fails in this environment during Electron startup. See the notes in this README and the source for the current runtime wiring.

### Build

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Product scope

CheapChat v1 is intentionally small:

- single-user desktop app
- local-only storage
- manual model selection
- text chat only

Out of scope for v1:

- accounts or cloud sync
- attachments and vision
- tools or function calling
- automatic provider routing
- hosted backend services

## Roadmap

### Providers

- [ ] OpenAI — API key + CLI OAuth login
- [ ] Google Gemini — API key + CLI OAuth login
- [ ] Anthropic Claude — API key support
- [ ] Multi-provider fallback — auto-failover between configured providers
- [ ] Provider health dashboard — per-provider status, last successful call, rate-limit indicators

### AI capabilities (powered by Vercel AI SDK)

- [ ] Tool / function calling — model tool use with local tool execution (web search, file read, code exec)
- [ ] Structured output — JSON mode for models that support it (`generateObject` / `streamObject`)
- [ ] Image input / vision — drag-and-drop images into the composer (multi-modal messages)
- [ ] Reasoning / thinking — expose model reasoning tokens for supported models
- [ ] Prompt templates — save and reuse common prompt patterns
- [ ] Auto-title conversations — generate titles from first message
- [ ] Model comparison — send the same prompt to multiple models side by side
- [ ] Streaming resume — reconnect and resume interrupted streams

### UI/UX

- [ ] Conversation search — full-text search across message history
- [ ] Message editing — edit and regenerate assistant responses
- [ ] Branch conversations — fork a conversation at any message
- [ ] Conversation export — Markdown, JSON, and PDF export per conversation
- [ ] Import conversations — restore from exported files
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts — quick model switch, new chat, search, settings
- [ ] Custom system prompts — per-conversation or global default
- [ ] Code block copy button — one-click copy on rendered code blocks
- [ ] Syntax highlighting — language-specific code highlighting
- [ ] Theme support — light mode, custom accent colors
- [ ] Window management — remember window size, position, sidebar state

### Core features

- [ ] Conversation memory — long-term memory with vector embeddings stored locally
- [ ] Session management — named sessions within a conversation, separate context windows
- [ ] Token budget controls — per-conversation or global max-token limits
- [ ] Cost tracking — estimated cost per message and per conversation (OpenRouter usage accounting built in)
- [ ] Offline mode — view history and draft messages without a network connection
- [ ] Conversation folders / tags — organize conversations with labels

### Platform

- [ ] Auto-updates — built-in update checker and silent background downloads
- [ ] Native menus — proper macOS/Windows/Linux application menus
- [ ] Tray icon — background operation with tray notifications
- [ ] Portable mode — run without installation (Windows/Linux)
- [ ] Code signing & notarization — macOS notarization, Windows code signing

## Repository layout

```text
src/main/       Electron main process, OpenRouter client, IPC, DB, keychain
src/preload/    Typed bridge exposed to the renderer
src/renderer/   React UI
src/shared/     Shared contracts and types
```

## Security model

- renderer code does not access secrets directly
- API calls happen from the Electron main process
- secrets are stored in the OS keychain, not SQLite
- renderer communication goes through a narrow preload API

This is still a personal-tool codebase moving toward public OSS quality. Review the code before using it with sensitive credentials.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Releases

CheapChat uses GitHub Releases for distribution. To cut a new release:

```bash
# bump patch (0.1.0 -> 0.1.1)
pnpm release

# bump minor (0.1.0 -> 0.2.0)
pnpm release:minor

# bump major (0.1.0 -> 1.0.0)
pnpm release:major
```

Then push the tag to trigger the release workflow:

```bash
git push && git push --tags
```

This triggers the CI release workflow, which builds macOS binaries and uploads them to a GitHub Release draft.
